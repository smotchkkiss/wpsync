# The (-d|-u|-p|-t)... thing is a hack to make docopt accept any,
# but at least one of -d, -u, -p, -t.
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/43983602
# A downside is that it will also accept multiple mentions, but I
# think it's still better than spelling out the options like
# (-d [-upt] | -u [-dpt] | -p [-dut] | -t [-dup])

# TODO:
# - on connect, check if a WordPress actually exists at the site,
#   and if not, maybe ask if the user wants to install one?
# - generally be generous with existing/non-existing directories
# - check: did I actually implement maintenance mode? maintenance
#   mode should be on, at least during database restore - better
#   during all backup and restore activities!
# - support databases with multiple installations or other stuff
#   than wordpress in them, add an optional 'mysql_prefix'
#   configuration option for that
# - unify all php code together into one server.php so we only have
#   to upload it once on connect
# - maybe add an option to persistently install the server? (no!)
# - make the server safer by using http simple auth with
#   automatically, per-connection generated passwords
# - would it somehow be possible to make [site] an optional
#   argument to restore (and not an option?)
# - publish to PyPI and/or, preferably, homebrew!
# - maybe refactor here and there for more consistent variable
#   names (backup_id vs ts_fs, source_site and dest_site vs source
#   and dest)
#   refactor for fewer [positional] arguments
# - check that we check that the local peer dependencies are
#   installed (lftp and so on!) - or even better, maybe we can
#   define those as dependencies in the homebrew formula? (but
#   anyway, still check for them programmatically, please!)
# - maybe update the PHP dependencies
# - add support for (project-)local configuration files and local
#   'wpsyncdir's in the respective location(s) - or find a way to
#   uniquely identify sites, for example by site_url (or a
#   filesystem-safe version of that), or a combination of the site
#   name and the path of the configuration file it belongs to ...
# - normalise config options like site_url to make sure they don't
#   have a trailing slash or trailing whitespace for example, or
#   hint the user towards it!
# - generally validate the config better
# - randomise the server side dir name for better security (but
#   make sure to remove it!)
# - what if more people are syncing the same site at the same time?
#   add individual ids or detect the other folders, e.g. by a
#   common ('wpsync-') prefix, so only the last one leaving removes
#   the maintenance file?
#   or maybe better, do nothing and wait until the others are
#   done - this may wait forever in case a wpsync dir is left over
#   from a crash! we should warn the user about this and advise how
#   to manually remove the old wpsync directories.
#   I HAVE AN IDEA FOR THIS.
#   if a wpsync dir already exists on the server, warn and exit.
#   add a --force option though that removes/overwrites the
#   existing dirs in case the user is sure that no one else is
#   syncing!
# - add a 'clean' command or something to remove old backups
# - add another 'clean' command that removes old wpsync dirs from
#   servers
# - auto-run the clean command at least once a day or so
# - but by all means try to remove the wpsync dir, maybe with a
#   python atexit hook or something that will run in almost every
#   case except for power outage or sudden connection loss or
#   something ... and in case of the connection loss, maybe still
#   write the name of the wpsync dir to a list of stale wpsync dirs
#   in the host info file so we know we can remove it next time?
# - maybe change the restore cli to [backup] [site] and, if both
#   are given, try to detect if [backup] is a backup_id or a site,
#   and so on ... ?
# - add waiting spinners on steps?
# - maybe add a verbose option again and make it show very verbose
#   output of lftp, rsync and other external tools
# - parallelise stuff, probably with asyncio
# - test wether everything works over each connection type
# - require particular (min/max?) versions of external dependencies
#   (like lftp and so on) and check that compatible versions are
#   installed. (if wpsync is published to homebrew they may even be
#   listed in the formula and installed automatically, but I think
#   that it has to be the latest version available on homebrew,
#   then.)
# - detect when a host uses http auth but it isn't configured
#   (401 Unauthorized) and show a meaningful error message
# - don't just print DONE at the end of the program, especially if
#   there were errors, and it also makes no sense with the list
#   command _at all_ I think.
# - compress backups
# - add a --only-files option to --full, or think of a better way,
#   but make it possible to explicitly include/exclude the database
# - also add an option to --full about wether to include or exclude
#   the .htaccess and wp-config.php files (when syncing to another
#   site)
# - or are the above 2 points a case of YAGNI and we can just go
#   with some default and in the rare cases where we need more
#   options we just do it by hand?
# - handle exit via KeyboardInterrupt more gracefully
# - make it possible to restore -dupt selectively from a --full
#   backup
# - if ssh isn't configured to work without entering a passphrase
#   interactively, wpsync is not usable _at all_. because the
#   password prompt is simply suppressed until wpsync crashes
#   because ssh crashes with too many failed authentication
#   attempts. this is really bad and should be changed! FIXME check
#   if it is possible to fix this with sh, otherwise probably ssh
#   will have to be run through subprocess.run instead!
